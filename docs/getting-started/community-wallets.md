    === "Receive"

        * Copy your address (`grin1...`) and provide it to the other party.

        ![grin++ receive step1](../assets/images/grinplusplus-receive.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        That's it. If both your wallets can communicate via Tor, the transaction is then completed automatically.

        *But if there's no Tor communication, next steps are:*

        * The sender will provide you a Slatepack message. Paste it into the Slatepack box and click Receive.

        ![grin++ receive step2](../assets/images/grinplusplus-receive2.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        * Copy the Slatepack message your wallet generates.

        ![grin++ slatepack](../assets/images/grinplusplus-slatepack.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        * Provide it to the sender.

        Done! The sender will finalize the transaction and post it to the chain.

    === "Send"

        * Click send.

        ![grin++ receive step3](../assets/images/grinplusplus-send.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        * Choose the amount of grins.

        ![grin++ receive step4](../assets/images/grinplusplus-send2.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        * Enter the receiver's address and send.

        ![grin++ receive step4](../assets/images/grinplusplus-send3.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        That's it. If both your wallets can communicate via Tor, the transaction is then completed automatically.

        *But if there's no Tor communication, next steps are:*

        * Copy the Slatepack message your wallet generates and provide it to the receiver (however you want).

        ![grin++ receive step4](../assets/images/grinplusplus-slatepack.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        * You should get a Slatepack message back from the receiver. Paste it into the Slatepack box and click Finalize.

        ![grin++ receive step4](../assets/images/grinplusplus-send4.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        Done! Your wallet will then finalize the transaction and post it to the chain.
