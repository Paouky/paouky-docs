# Documents to keep

Documents to keep, but that might not have proper place in the new structure.

## From wiki

- [Mimblewimble Whitepaper](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/MimbleWimble-Origin) - Obviously.
- [How to: Run a Grin node on Google Cloud for free](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/How-to%3A-Run-a-Grin-node-on-Google-Cloud-for-free) - A very useful guide to run a cloud node.
- ~~[Community projects~~](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Community-projects) - A useful list but hard to keep up to date. Worth keeping for users asking about exchanges.~~
- ~~[News and Channels~~](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/News-and-Channels) - Maybe update and keep, not sure if its needed.~~
- [Regarding Foundations](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Regarding-Foundations) - A well written overview that's worth keeping.
- ~~[Troubleshooting~~](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Troubleshooting) - Needs revisiting, not sure how and by who.~~
- [Build and run automation](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Build-and-run-automation) - A guide to run grin as a service seems useful. Needs polishing.
- [Monetary Policy](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Monetary-Policy) - Replaced by [Emission](https://paouky.github.io/docs/about-grin/emission/) but a good document nevertheless.

### Move to grin/doc

Very technical documents that have their place in the grin repo. They are not perfect but so are most grin repo docs. Still useful.

- ~~[P2P Protocol](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/P2P-Protocol) (MOVED)~~
- ~~[Validation logic](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Validation-logic) (MOVED)~~
- ~~[Block Header](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Block-Header)~~

### Move to grin-pm

- ~~[Adding repos to mimblewimble](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Adding-repos-to--mimblewimble) - Should find a suitable place (MOVED)~~


### Move to grin-miner

- [How to mine Grin](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/How-to-mine-Grin)

### Pages

- ~~[Events](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Events) - A nice list of past events. Most links are useless, but maybe worth keeping. Some good slides hidden there.~~
- ~~[Roadmap](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Roadmap) - Not sure what to do with it. It looks relatively up-to-date but is not needed imo.~~
- ~~[The Story of Distribution](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/The-Story-of-Distribution) - I like it. I'm biased though.~~


### Plain fun

- [Nomenclature BS](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/Nomenclature-BS) - I love this, such a creative mind. Core team should have remained the technocratic council **cough** **cough**.
- [User Stories Use Cases](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/User-Stories---Use-cases) - This shit cracks me up.
- ~~[No this, no that](https://github.com/mimblewimble/docs/wiki/No-this%2C-no-that) - Very succint, cool.~~
