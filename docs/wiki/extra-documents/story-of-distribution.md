# Story of Distribution

**Stories are important**; We often commemorate them, and they broadly impact our perception.

Bitcoin's story of inception cannot be matched in its perfection. Its story of distribution however, will remain flawed, gradually turning into a bigger stain with each passing year. Aside from its clear financial implications, it presents an unwelcoming & discouraging narrative to new adopters, as if they are valued less than the previous ones.

Grin's decision to set itself apart in its story of distribution is controversial, but nevertheless an invaluable distinguishing factor in forming a more positive and welcoming narrative for Grin in its future.

Stories never die. A story of fairness & moderation contrasted with that of quick enrichment for early users will remain rewarding for Grin, as it seeks to claim relevance for years to come.
