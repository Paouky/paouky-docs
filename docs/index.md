Simple, privacy-focused, scalable Mimblewimble chain implementation.

Grin aims to serve as digital cash. To provide electronic transactions for all, without censorship or restrictions.

## Principles

### Open

Grin is developed openly, by individual contributors all over the world. There's no company or foundation behind it, and no ICO, founder reward, pre-mine or dev-tax. The coin distribution is designed to be as fair (but not gratis) as is known to be possible.

### Privacy

Privacy by default. Transactions have no amount, no addresses and can be trivially aggregated. This enables complete fungibility without precluding the ability to selectively disclose information as needed.

### Scalability

Scales mostly with the number of users and minimally with the number of transactions. Past transactional data can be pruned, making it drastically lightweight compared to other blockchains.

### Simplicity

Minimal implementation that strives to remain as clear and simple as possible, making it easy to audit and maintain over time.

### Proven Cryptography

Mimblewimble only relies on strong Elliptic Curve cryptography which has been tried and tested for decades.
