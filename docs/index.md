# Welcome to the Grin Documentation

Grin aims to serve as digital cash, providing electronic transactions for all, without censorship or restrictions.

As a minimal implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol, it offers extremely good privacy, scalability and fungibility.

## Principles

### Privacy

Privacy by default. Transactions have no amount, no addresses and can be trivially aggregated. This enables complete fungibility without precluding the ability to selectively disclose information as needed.

### Scalability

Scales mostly with the number of users and minimally with the number of transactions. Past transactional data can be pruned, making it drastically lightweight compared to other blockchains.

### Design Simplicity

Minimal implementation that strives to remain as clear and simple as possible, making it easy to audit and maintain over time.

### Proven Cryptography

Mimblewimble only relies on strong Elliptic Curve cryptography which has been tried and tested for decades.

### Community Driven

No company, foundation or individual behind Grin. No ICO, founder reward, pre-mine or dev-tax. Built openly by individual contributors distributed all over the world.
