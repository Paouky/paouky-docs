in our case, when two outputs are encypted (commits), one can still compute the encryption of the sum of both outputs, and verify that it's a multlipiaction of the G generator point.


My personal preference for MimbleWimble comes from its extreme simplicity (especially compared to zk-snarks) and great scalability. It's also less opaque than zcash, you can still reason about inputs and outputs while all identifiable information about them is obscured.


Confidence in certain cryptography is gained by having it last a long time without being broken. Mimblewimble only relies on elliptic curves; simple and very well vetted cryptographic constructs and assumptions.
